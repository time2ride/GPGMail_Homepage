          <h1>What is GPG Mail?</h1>
                <p>GPG Mail is an open source plugin for Apple Mail. It brings the functionality to sign, verify, encrypt and decrypt mails using the PGP standard.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>sign mail</li>
                  <li>encrypt mail</li>
                  <li>verify mail</li>
                  <li>decrypt mail</li>
                </ul>
          <h1>Why do I need it?</h1>
                <p>The personal privacy is one of the most underestimated goods everyone of us has. By encrypting your mails before sending them over the internet you prevent others from reading them during the delivery process. Where the "others" can not only be negligible hackers but more importand criminal individuals, business companies or even governments interested in your personal information for various reasons some of them you can't even imagine! <br />
                	Another point is the origin of information. Every piece of information has its source that inseperably belongs to it. The source of an information is almost as importand as the information itself. By using GPG Mail the reciever of an email can be sure the information has been sent by only you. He even can tell if the content has been altered on its way through the internet and is therefore not valid for you. PGP messages cannot be faked! - Not partially, not completely, NOT AT ALL!
